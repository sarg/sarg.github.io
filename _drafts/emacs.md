I've chose my next toy. It will be mechanical ergonomic keyboard with separate parts for each hand. Something like ErgoDox or Kinesis.

I've decided to train my typing skills first and to get rid of using mouse.

I am long time vim user. Despite that I have chosen emacs side now. I did it mostly because emacs bindings feel more naturally for my hands.

Awesome
* window movement
* custom layouts for coding on large resolution monitor
Browser
* switch from chromium to firefox, because of emacs-plugin (keysnail)
Mail
* in progress
Shell
* readline in emacs mode
