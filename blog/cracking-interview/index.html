<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32794226-cracking-the-code-to-a-successful-interview">Goodreads</a> - 3/5.</p>
<p>First impression:
Overall the tone of the book is slightly arrogant. The author&rsquo;s ego is soaking from every page.</p>
<p>After the read:
The book is best suited for a sales position in corporate America.
Overall the message of the book is: <strong>Be prepared, know what&rsquo;s expected of you and give it to the inverviewer in advance.</strong>
In chapter 9 there is a summary of REAPRICH method. Chapter 10-12,15 are unrelated to hiring process.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-1-dot">Chapter 1.</h2>
<p>Hiring managers could be of 4 types:</p>
<ul>
<li>the power tripper - tries to prove his own intellectual prowess</li>
<li>the defensive crouhcer - feels unsafe with poeple they fear could do their jobs better</li>
<li>method man - follows script and expects valid answers</li>
<li>rogue agent - not fitting in 3 types above, dark horse</li>
</ul>
<p>REAPRICH - 8 step plan to win the interview.
results / energy / attitude / process / relationships / interview the  interviewer / close the interviewer / humanity</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h2>
<ul>
<li>research the company</li>
<li>polish resume</li>
<li>be tenacious</li>
</ul>
<p>On the day of interview - be on time, dress well, shine your shoes, bring hard copy of your resume, give a firm handshake, look into the eye.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t discuss personal problems, family, bad experiences with past employers.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-3-dot-rea">Chapter 3. REA</h2>
<p>Be enthusiastic (E - energy) and have positive A (attitude).</p>
<h2 id="chapter-4-dot-p-spotlight-on-creativity">Chapter 4. P - Spotlight on creativity</h2>
<p>You’re in great shape if the manager ends up saying, “I want you on board so you can do this for me or my team. I want this to be a part of our skill set and our arsenal as we move forward as an organization.”</p>
<h2 id="chapter-5-dot-r-relationships">Chapter 5. R - Relationships</h2>
<p>One of the biggest fears of hiring managers is having a personality conflict on their team. Showing that you have the ability to create and maintain relationships alleviates this fear.</p>
<p>Exercise:
Write down two long-term relationships such as bosses, coaches, mentors, or friends (one which affected your career). Answer the following questions in writing for each: How did you secure this relationship? Was it through performance? How did this person become interested in you? How did he or she see positive qualities in you? How did you build and nurture this connection?</p>
<h2 id="chapter-6-dot-i-interview-the-interviewer">Chapter 6. I - interview the interviewer</h2>
<p>Ask something that you can&rsquo;t find in public sources.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell me about some of your most successful people. What’s made them great?</li>
<li>How can I help your team? What is the best way my skills could add value?</li>
<li>If you hired me today, what would you have me help you and your team with in the first three months?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-7-dot-close-the-interview">Chapter 7. Close the interview</h2>
<p>Like in sales - try to close the deal.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-8-dot-humanity">Chapter 8. Humanity</h2>
<p>Small talk in the end. Author suggests to directly ask if you&rsquo;re recommended for hire.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-9-dot-recap-dot">Chapter 9. Recap.</h2>
<p>The most successful interview candidates aren’t necessarily the most experienced, the most educated, or the most qualified for the job. They are the best prepared.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-14-dot-tough-questions">Chapter 14. Tough questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Who are you?</li>
<li>Why should I hire you?</li>
<li>Give an example of a time you tried your best and failed.</li>
<li>Who was the worst boss (or employee) you ever worked with?</li>
<li>What four words would someone close to you use to describe you?</li>
<li>Who was your best mentor?</li>
<li>What do you feel you will bring to this organization?</li>
<li>Where do you want to be in five years?</li>
<li>What is your greatest weakness?</li>
<li>What is your ninety-day plan to be successful here?</li>
<li>Give me an example of where you took a difficult customer or situation and turned it into a win.</li>
</ol>
