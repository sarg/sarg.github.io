<p>Summary</p>
<p>2010-present java webdev, 2006-2010 perl webdev. I know java, kotlin, python, perl. Linux user since 2001, can do DevOps but nothing fancy. In Java I&rsquo;ve worked mostly with Spring and Hibernate and now I prefer smaller hand-picked libraries. I “grok” things, follow best practices and keep things simple. I can work autonomously but it’s important for me to have like-minded colleagues for technical discussions. I think that readability of code is really important so I strive for clean code and thorough documentation. I have a BSc in Software Engineering and have EU Blue Card residence permit.</p>

<h4 id="exporting-secrets-from-freeotp-to-pass"><span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> Exporting secrets from FreeOTP to Pass</h4>
<p>I have broken my phone screen. Not a big deal but I use it for 2FA. While
replacement is on the way I will extract credentials from <a href="https://freeotp.github.io/">FreeOTP</a> and import
them in <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">password store</a>. Be aware that it is completeley against the idea of 2FA,
because now both password and otp are on the same device.</p>
<p>So, first I need to find where FreeOTP stores OTP secrets. Android apps
usually use sqlite db for that, but not in this case. FreeOTP uses shared_prefs.</p>
<p>Pull prefs from the phone (root needed).</p>

Or you can manually put <code>otpauth://</code> string in an appropriate pass file. I did
the latter way, because my already existing entries have had another names.
Then check that everything went fine - <code>pass otp 'Amazon Web Services/sarg@organization'</code></p>

<h4 id="backing-up-android-phone"><span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> Backing up Android phone</h4>
<p>One day my wife asked me to help her backup about 30Gb of photos from her
android phone. At first we had tried to copy files over MTP (in Win10). This
idea quickly showed its incapacity. You see, Win10 wants to be nice and tries
to calculate ETA. But 30Gb is a lot of files and over MTP it takes one request
per file to get its size. So, we waited half an hour while Win10 was preparing
to start the transfer and I had aborted this madness.</p>
<p>Here is a sane approach to do the job.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/org.galexander.sshd/">SimpleSSHD</a> on the phone.
Set <code>&quot;Start on Open&quot;</code> in app settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grab <a href="https://github.com/google/adb-sync#adb-channel"><code>adb-channel</code></a> script and add this snippet to <code>~/.ssh/config</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Host sshelper
    Port 2222
    ProxyCommand adb-channel tcp:%p org.galexander.sshd/.SimpleSSHD 1
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p>Copy your public key to the phone.</p>
<p>Please note that <code>ssh-copy-id</code> won&rsquo;t work. Just <code>ssh sshelper</code> and then paste
the key into <code>authorized_keys</code>. Details <a href="http://www.galexander.org/software/simplesshd/">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now backup with rsync as usual.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">rsync -e ssh -av sshelper:/sdcard/DCIM .
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p>Optional</p>
<p>This setup assumes that you copy files over USB. But nothing stops you from
starting SimpleSSHD manually and copy files over WiFi.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">rsync -e <span style="color:#b44">&#39;ssh -p 2222&#39;</span> -av 192.168.178.42:/sdcard/DCIM .
</code></pre></div></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="exporting-watch-list-from-tmdb"><span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> Exporting watch list from TMDb</h4>
<p>I keep list of movies I&rsquo;ve watched on <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/u/sarg/ratings">TheMovieDB</a>. The service is great and I&rsquo;ve
used it for quite a long time (&gt;700 movies in my list). I was using another
service before, which unfortunately had closed without giving me a chance to
export the data and I had to scrape my watchlist from google cache.</p>
<p>To prevent that from happening again, I&rsquo;ve exported my watchlist from TMDb and
will use the service only as a secondary source with nice UI.</p>
<p>TMDb has a decent API and there are several python wrappers for it. The script
for export is pretty straightforward. Retrieve <code>request_token</code>, open session
(login) for your account and retrieve the list of rated movies from paginated endpoint.</p>
