<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
<p>A position in software engineering with autonomy and challenge. I would like to try myself in mentoring and leading small teams.</p>
<h3 id="skills">Skills</h3>
<ul>
<li>designing and implementing scalable distributed web applications from the ground up</li>
<li>adopting best practices in coding / documenting / deploying / monitoring</li>
<li>refactoring and optimizing applications without end user impact</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>2010-present java webdev, 2006-2010 perl webdev. I know java, kotlin, python, perl. Linux user since 2001, can do DevOps but nothing fancy. In Java I&rsquo;ve worked mostly with Spring and Hibernate and now I prefer smaller hand-picked libraries. I “grok” things, follow best practices and keep things simple. I can work autonomously but it’s important for me to have like-minded colleagues for technical discussions. I think that readability of code is essential in long term so I strive for clean code and thorough documentation. I have a BSc in Software Engineering and have EU Blue Card residence permit.</p>
